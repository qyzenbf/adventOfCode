# Advent of Code 2016
This repository is for the Advent of Code challenge 2016ï¼ˆhttps://adventofcode.com/2016). It includes Day1, Day4 and Day10. For eachday's challenge, I give my solution as well as unit test cases for each method.

## How to Run Test Cases
### * If you have IDE 
If you have IDE such as `Intellij` or `Eclipse`), you can: 

1. Make sure you have jdk installed. [Here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) is how;
2. As well, make sure you have Git installed. [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is how;
3. Clone project to local by command:
```shell script
git clone github.com/qyzenbf/adventOfCode
```
4. Open project using IDE. Find test cases in directory `src`&#8594;`test`&#8594;`java`

### * If you don't run code in IDE

1. Make sure your computer have maven building tool. Find it [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html);
